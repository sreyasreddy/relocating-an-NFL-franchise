Relocating an NFL Franchise

Executive Summary

I am passionate about sports, and in particular, the science and business behind professional sports franchises. I want to not only learn what it takes to own, operate, and manage a franchise, but also why and how an owner relocates a professional sports team from one city to another. While I do plan to explore team statistical data in the realm of football, I also want to incorporate some historical data on the cities hosting the franchises being analyzed.

Motivation

As a fan of the NFL’s Tennessee Titans, I am forever grateful that the then-owner of the Houston Oilers decided to move his franchise to Nashville in the late 1990s. If not for that relocation, it is hard to imagine myself being as much of an aficionado of professional sports as I am today.

Data Question(s)

What are the most important factors for an owner when deciding whether or not to renew his or her lease with the current city’s stadium? What are the most important factors for an owner when determining which city to relocate his or her franchise to?
